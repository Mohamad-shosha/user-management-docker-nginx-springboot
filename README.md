# Spring Boot with Docker and Nginx Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of Docker for deployment, Nginx as a reverse proxy, and Spring Boot for backend development. It provides a foundational setup for deploying Spring Boot applications in a containerized environment and serves as a starting point for scaling applications in a real-world environment.

## Features

- **Spring Boot Backend**: A simple Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API.
- **Docker**: The project is containerized using Docker to ensure portability and scalability across different environments.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Nginx is set up as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the Spring Boot application, enabling better performance, security, and scalability.
- **Easy Deployment**: With Docker and Nginx, you can deploy the application easily and ensure it runs smoothly in production.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11+** (to run the Spring Boot application)
- **Docker** (to build and run containers)
- **Nginx** (to reverse proxy traffic to the Spring Boot app)
- **Maven** (to build the Spring Boot project)
